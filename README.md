# match-analysis
Some standard visualisations of match analysis.

Similar to the Voronoi repository; this work is heavily supported through the brilliant & highly recommended tutorials available in Soccermatics which make analysing football data so much easier.

You will find a collection of analysis, looking at passing networks (both individually and as a team) and some depictions of shot locations too.
